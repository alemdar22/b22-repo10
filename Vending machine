Very first thing I prepare is test documentation in other words my to do list
Before I start testing the VM i make sure that all testable features are visible and physically accessible.As a tester I will find out and report the expected and actuals results.
The purpose of this test is that the user should be able insert money and get a drink from the VM.

As a tester I check and verify that VM is plugged in so that the test cases can be conducted as expected.
This VM is for 10 types cold drinks and the capacity is 60 drinks.so check if every single drink exists in the VM as stated in the requirement.
Check if the drinks and the code numbers are clearly visible to the user.

Next i go on with functional testing.
-check if display screen works and display screen is readeble by user.
-check if there is a language option.
check if product buttons from 0-9  are there and working properly
-check if product codes match the entered product.
-check if the slot for coins accepts coins and the coin counter correctly counts the amount insertd.
-check if there is any direction for the location of returned coins or bills
check if coin and paper money sections cooperate properly
-check if paper money section accepts and VM returns correct change if there is any.
check if cc swiper functions rights.
-check if the item drops down and is available for the user to collect.
check if there is enough room in the dispenser area for the users hand to collect the drink.
-check if VM is suitable for the disabled user 

I also test the hardware with various scenarios
-check if the color of VM is as required by the customer
-check if the logo of the customer is correctly located on the VM as required by the customer
-check if the buttons to enter the drink code are not too high up for the average height user
-check if the VM is properly locked.
-check if coin collecter is not too small for storing coins
-check if day time and night time lighting in the VM works properly

As a tester my other approach will be  testin gperformance of the VM
-check if enterd code correctly any entered item is coming out
-check if the items comes out at a standard time .. not early not late
-check if the cooler of the VM keeps the drinks at the desired temperature not colder nor warmer
-check the max and min amount of money accepted by the VM

I also perform a security test by
- check if correct voltage is used for the VM
-check if VM safely connected to the wall behind it so it never gets shaky
-check if  mandatory warning signs by law are visible

Coming to the negative test cases;
- I can try a real but donâ€™t have sufficient balanced credit card and I should be able to see warning message and not dispense the product.
 - I can try a card which not like a credit card (costco card..) and I should be able to see the transaction not to go 
- I can try with in proper cash/coin machine does not give desire item.
-check when  power is out and an extra battery is installed so Vm still runs and drinks are kept cold.
-check if there is no power user should see "drinks are not cold" message
- check if paper money accepter sorts out counterfit bills and gives warning to the user
-check with foreign currency
-check by entering invalid code

STRESS TEST
- shake it
-kick it
-press hard on buttons
-bang on the screen 

If VM passes all these tests it  is  ready  and safe to use.
